        <h1>WHAT I DO NOW?</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the ‚ÄúWhat I Do Now‚Äù chapter! Here‚Äôs a sneak peek into my day-to-day adventures:,</p>

        <p>At the heart of it all, I‚Äôm the Head of Engineering at Shuttle. 
            My days are filled with coding, strategizing, and making sure our 
            tech team is running smoother than a well-oiled cricket bat.  
            My role keeps me on my toes, but I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
           The thrill of turning complex challenges into sleek solutions is my daily caffeine!</p>

        <p> Outside the tech world, you‚Äôll find me diving into a good book. 
            Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of a classic novel or absorbing the 
            latest in tech and self-improvement, 
            reading is my go-to for expanding horizons and escaping into different worlds. üìö</p>
            
        <p> When I'm not buried in code or books, 
            I‚Äôm on the cricket field, either training to bowl 
            a fast one or batting my way through a match. There‚Äôs nothing 
            quite like the sound of a cricket ball hitting the bat‚Äîor the 
            satisfying feeling of a perfectly executed delivery. üèè
        </p> 
            
        <p>I‚Äôm also learning to meditate, which is a delightful contrast to the fast-paced 
            tech and cricket scenes. 
            Finding that inner calm amidst the chaos has become a new favorite hobby, 
            and I‚Äôm slowly becoming a zen master in training. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>   
            
        <p> Learning to write! From crafting captivating narratives 
            to honing my storytelling skills, 
            I‚Äôm exploring the art of writing with the same passion 
            I bring to my professional and personal pursuits. ‚úçÔ∏è</p>  
            
        <p>So, if you‚Äôre ever curious about what keeps me busy, 
            just remember: it‚Äôs a mix of engineering marvels, 
            literary escapades, cricketing feats, meditative moments, 
            and creative writing. Feel free to reach out or join me in any of these adventures. 
            Who knows? We might end up sharing a good book recommendation, a cricket match, or a moment of zen!</p>
